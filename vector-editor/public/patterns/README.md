# Pattern Assets

This directory contains pattern assets for the vector editor. 

For real production use, you would replace these files with actual patterns. The pattern files would be:

- `stripes.png`: A striped pattern
- `dots.png`: A dotted pattern
- `grid.png`: A grid pattern
- `zigzag.png`: A zigzag pattern
- `checker.png`: A checkerboard pattern

These patterns should be:
- Small, tileable images (e.g., 64x64 pixels)
- Transparent background with the pattern in black (or other colors)
- Saved as PNG with transparency

For best results, create seamless patterns that will tile without visible seams.
